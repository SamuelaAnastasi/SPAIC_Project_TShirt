# SPAIC_Project_TShirt
This project is part of study groups initiative during Secure and Private Ai Challenge from Udacity and Facebook . The implementation is based on Gaty's neural style transfer paper and uses pretrained models (VGG19) to implement the style transfer from the style image to the content image.
